       <h3><a name="howwecollectanduseinformation">1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</a></h3>



<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use, provided at <em>[insert link]</em>.</p>

<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

<p>
<strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a HingeTo account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Information we may receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the HingeTo application, linking your account to the HingeTo Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to HingeTo. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join HingeTo. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the HingeTo Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Inviting a friend to use HingeTo from the “Invite friends” feature:</strong> If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, we may collect information contained in your contact list. You understand that by inviting a friend to HingeTo through the “Invite friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Finding your friends on the Service:</strong> If you choose, you can locate your friends with HingeTo accounts through our “Find friends” feature. The “Find friends” feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on HingeTo. If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide HingeTo access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using HingeTo. If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to us to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on HingeTo.</p>

<p>
We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages and push notifications, to allow you to locate others and have others locate you on the Service, and to permit you to share content with others on the Service. We may also send you Service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). For more information about your communication preferences, see “Your Choices Regarding Your Information” below.</p>

<p>
We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Service; and (g) automatically update the HingeTo application on your mobile devices.</p>

			<p>

HingeTo may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content.

In that situation, HingeTo determines the target audience and HingeTo serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

			<p>
			The HingeTo Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>
